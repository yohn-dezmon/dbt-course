# dbt Overview

- dbt is T (transform)
- L/T comes before T (ELT)
- one distinction he made between dbt and running SQL statements is that in dbt everything is saved, so you can see which SQL statements were run previously, against which versions of the data.
- there is version control
- there is alerting
- there is logging...
- there is testing... documentation... deployments in dev/stage/prod


"analytics engineer"...
is that the new "data engineer"

ok wow so analytics engineer sounds VERY similar to data engineer except that you're supposed to know a bit more about the domain.

So definitely apply to analytics engineer positions if you see them. They'll expect you to have good SQL skills.

Inside Airbnb --> Airbnb's data sharing website!  

Where else can I get data for personal projects, I think Ben Rojogan has a post about this as well. 
* OpenSky -- flight data 
* Spacetrack -- tracks artificial satellites orbiting the earth 
* New York Times Annotated Corpus
* Libray of Congress Dataset Repository 
* US Government data sets 
* free public data sets at Tableau 

In the first project:
- dbt 
- snowflake (data warehouse free trial)
- preset (superset... managed... dashboard)

dependencies are EXPLICIT. (files that depend on each other)
easy to overview (easy to view dependencies).  
data quality tests!!!  
error reporting
